 Before I put the customary Sessional Orders to the House, I have a brief statement to make. As Members may be aware, the Procedure Committee has recently published a report on the Sessional Orders and resolutions. I hope that it will receive the attention that it deserves, and that the House will be given the opportunity to take a decision on the Committee's recommendations. If the recommendations are approved, proceedings on this occasion next year will take a rather different form. In the meantime, I hope that the House will be patient and good-humoured, as it normally is, while I follow the traditional formalities.

 All I want to say, Mr. Speaker, is that, as the only former police officer serving in this Chamber, it occurs to me&#151;as it has on many occasions at the point at which you put the Sessional Order in respect of the security of the Palace&#151;that the House should thank the police and security staff for the work that they do in protecting this Chamber. They are very often unseen behind the scenes, but they do a first-class job, in the most difficult of circumstances at the present time, and somebody ought to get to their feet once in a while to thank them for it.
<P>
<P>
<!--META NAME="Colno" CONTENT="3"--><A NAME="31126-01_spnew4"></A><B> Mr. Speaker: </B> <!--Mr. Speaker-->
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that point of order. As he knows, the Serjeant at Arms is the senior officer responsible for security. I assure the hon. Gentleman and the House that the Serjeant is regularly thanked personally by me, as the Speaker of the House, for the good work that is being done. He and his team are very much the unsung heroes in this House, particularly at the moment.
