<!--META NAME="Colno" CONTENT="4"--><A NAME="41116-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wade of Chorlton: </B> <!--Lord Wade of Chorlton-->  My Lords, I beg to move, That a humble Address be presented to Her Majesty as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Most Gracious Sovereign&#151;We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to thank Your Majesty for the most gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament."</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para48"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->It is an enormous privilege for me to have the opportunity, on behalf of the whole House of Lords, to thank Her Majesty and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales for being present with us today. The whole nation admires our Sovereign and appreciates the great honour which Her Majesty brings to Britain.
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para49"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->We are delighted that Her Majesty will be receiving visits from the Amir of Kuwait and the President of Finland. I am sure that all noble Lords are pleased that Britain was able to play such an important role in driving the Iraqi forces from Kuwait, thus enabling the <P>


<a name="column_5"></a>

<B>16 Nov 1994 : Column 5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Amir to visit Britain as the leader of a free country. I have visited Finland on many occasions and have a great affection for those most friendly and able people. I wish the President a most happy stay in Britain.
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para50"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->It is very pleasing to know that Her Majesty will be visiting South Africa in the coming year. I know that we all have tremendous admiration for the leaders of that country who have led it through very difficult times with great success and who will, we hope, move it forward to become one of the great countries of the world. It is right that Britain should support it in every possible way as it develops in the future.
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para51"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->We know that Her Majesty will have a great welcome in New Zealand and that there will be a most successful Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting there in November.
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para52"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->I am one of the few Members of your Lordships' House from the North-West of England who has had the privilege of moving the humble Address&#151;and I am a cheesemaker to boot. I am most grateful to my noble friends the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip for asking me to move the humble Address on this occasion, which is their first opening of Parliament in their new roles. I congratulate them on their appointments and wish them great success.
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para53"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->However, I must advise your Lordships that this is a nerve-racking experience. Indeed, had I realised the stress that I would feel, I might not have accepted my noble friends' invitation quite so readily. It caused me to remember an occasion when I was selling cheese in the United States&#151;English cheese, I might add. I was asked by a lady from Cleveland Television to explain the various merits of English cheese. I thought that I did so rather successfully, but her last question was, "Doesn't English cheese contain a lot of cholesterol and isn't that very bad for you?", to which I replied, "I have been eating English cheese all my life and look at me". She said, "Sir Wade, you must understand that there are an awful lot of people in America who don't want to look like you". That always made me very conscious of the fact that what I say may not necessarily be accepted by others.
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para54"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->However, I am particularly pleased that, on this occasion, my proposals should be seconded by my very good and noble friend Lord Lindsay. I know that he will deal most excellently with the matters that I miss and will no doubt do so in a very much more erudite way. It is a Northern team, and none the worse for it.
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para55"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->I have no connection with the Armed Forces, but place enormous importance on our national security. I believe that, through our continuing involvement with NATO, we shall be able to secure ongoing peace in Europe. However, it is on the strength of Britain's own Armed Forces that we all depend. I am grateful for this opportunity to thank them for all that they do and trust that they will continue to have the full and positive support of the British Government and of the British people.
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para56"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->Clearly there is much to be done to draw together the Armed Forces of all the countries within Europe to work for a common goal. We wish the Government every success during the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and as regards the full <P>


<a name="column_6"></a>

<B>16 Nov 1994 : Column 6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>implementation of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty. The Government are also to be congratulated on the tremendous efforts that they have put into trying to find a peaceful settlement in what was formerly Yugoslavia. I am sure that we all wish them well in their continuing efforts, as we must also wish them every success in dealing with the problems of weapons of mass destruction which could now so easily fall into the wrong hands.
<P>

<a name="41116-01_para57"></a><!--META NAME="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Wade of Chorlton"-->Terrorism everywhere in the world seeks to destroy democracy. Democratic nations must do all that they can to fight it. I believe that we should all congratulate this Government, and particularly our Prime Minister, on negotiating a peace in Northern Ireland.
