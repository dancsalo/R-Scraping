My noble friend Lady Ashton of Upholland is a delightful and approachable colleague. Her competence is evidently appreciated on all sides of the House, in view of the fact that she has been elected by her peers in successive years as Lords Minister of the Year and Peer of the Year. As to the Chief Whip, my noble friend Lord Grocott&#151;or the Captain of the Honourable Corps of the Gentleman-at-Arms, as I should call him today of all days after his resplendent appearance before us this morning during the State Opening&#151;not only was he an effective and highly respected colleague during my first two Parliaments as a Member of another place, but he is the embodiment of a great Chief Whip, in that you are rarely conscious of the discipline but feel bad if you let him down.

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0711069000060"></a>I am just starting my third year as a Member of your Lordships' House and have been reflecting on the experience. I was talking to our late lamented and noble friend Tony Banks&#151;Lord Stratford, or Lord Banks of the Thames, as I gather he wanted to be called&#151;the night the House rose for the Christmas Recess of 2005, which was his last night here. We swapped notes and I pointed out that our intake had reduced the average age in your Lordships&#146; House to 69. He said that it meant that overnight he had become a young Turk, having previously been a boring old&#151;I think that noble Lords know what word he used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0711069000061"></a>My former right honourable friend Tony Benn recalls his late father, Lord Stansgate, joking that after being in the Commons for years the one thing that he could not get used to in the Lords was all the good will. The conclusion I draw is that this House is by and large comprised of people who have a wealth of experience of life and who are beyond ambition because we have nothing to prove. All I will say to the Government is that in the process of constitutional change they should make sure that these two essential qualities are not lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0711069000062"></a>When the history of our period in office is written, it will be acknowledged that we changed the political discourse on public services. No party in the foreseeable future can be elected without a wholehearted and generous commitment to health, education, social security and housing. It is a remarkable achievement. I was very proud of the fact that after we came to power in 1997 it was in the poorest parts of my constituency of Bristol East&#151;areas that are not on any tourist map&#151;that the first new school and health centre were built. Now every secondary school in Bristol has been or is being rebuilt. Such things matter, and not only for teachers and health professionals; the quality of local services is seen as a direct reflection of the worth that we place on local communities. Whenever I see a TV news presenter standing outside a hospital, I always look at the building. It is remarkable how often it is new.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0711069000063"></a>I know from my own family experience how life- enhancing public services can be. My paternal grandfather was born in a workhouse. He left school at 11 to work as a miner. My father left school at 15. He eventually found it hard to get work because he

I left school at 16 and went to university in my mid-40s, after my children had graduated. I then trained as a lawyer. I now live a life of relative privilege but I never forget those who, like my family, are utterly dependent on our public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0711069000064"></a>There is a similar story to tell on youth unemployment. Early in the 1992-97 Parliament, my parliamentary friend and neighbour, the right honourable Dawn Primarolo, visited a secondary school in her constituency at the end of the academic year. She was told that 100 students were leaving but that only 11 of them had a job to go to. Ten years later, when I told this story to a group of school leavers in my constituency, they did not believe me, because they all had jobs and training places to go to. Consequently, I was delighted that the gracious Speech included legislation on housing, pensions, health and public transport. The proposals to improve the life chances of looked-after children are particularly welcome, as is the intention to help people to achieve a better balance between work and family life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0711069000065"></a>The phrase &#147;knowledge economy&#148; is often bandied about, but there is no doubt that Britain&#146;s economic status can be secured in the future only if we have a well educated and highly skilled population. In this context, the proposal to raise to 18 the minimum age at which young people can leave education or training is both welcome and vital. It is more than 40 years since the announcement that the school leaving age would be increased to 16 and in that time huge strides have been made in other countries. India, for example, is turning out 1 million science graduates a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0711069000066"></a>I have left until last the issue that is most important&#151;climate change. You do not have to be a weather forecaster or a scientist to work out that our climate is changing; it is obvious to any experienced gardener. It is the only credible explanation for the extreme weather phenomena that we have seen in recent years, from Hurricane Katrina, to severe drought, to disastrous floods. It is a relief that at last there appears to be unanimity in the science community worldwide that human activity is changing our climate. Late converts are to be preferred to sinners, but global progress is slow. It was in 1979 that I first learnt that there was a hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic. We were told then that all would be well if we stopped using chlorofluorocarbons, so my contribution at that time was to stop using deodorant sprays. Wouldn&#146;t it be great if that had been enough? The Climate Change Bill is our most ambitious initiative yet: to move beyond Kyoto so as to reduce the UK&#146;s carbon dioxide emissions by at least 60 per cent by 2050, using 1990 as the baseline. It is worth recording in passing that we are one of the few countries to comply with the Kyoto targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0711069000067"></a>The Energy Bill is the other side of the same coin, with its emphasis on a more rapid deployment of renewables in the UK. While wind farms, carbon capture and initiatives such as a Severn barrage may well have their place, I am convinced that there is growing public enthusiasm for microgeneration. People want to do their bit for the environment. Generous grant schemes for householders and the encouragement of microgeneration in public buildings are good common

Also very welcome are the proposals to target fuel poverty measures more effectively so as to build on energy-saving measures, such as home insulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0711069000068"></a>Occasionally, I reflect on an experience that I had about 30 years ago. I was campaigning in a local government by-election in south Devon, together with a party colleague called Norman. I thought that he was old, although he was probably about the age that I am now. It was just coming up to lunchtime and I decided to stop, but I realised that Norman had been detained on a doorstep. I went to inquire what was happening and it turned out that, after Norman&#146;s introduction, the householder had said that he would not be able to vote. Norman assumed that that meant he had just moved in and was not on the register, so he explained the procedure for doing so. The man said, &#147;No, no; I can&#146;t vote&#148;, and Norman thought that he meant that he wanted a postal vote. He explained the procedure and offered him an application form. The householder then said very loftily to both of us, &#147;No, you misunderstand. I can&#146;t vote because I&#146;m a Jehovah&#146;s Witness. My vote is in heaven&#148;. Norman replied, quick as a flash, &#147;But you come down for your meals, don&#146;t you?&#148;. We all come down for our meals, and we have common aims of protecting the security and safety of the British people, looking after all our children, providing world-class education and skills and reducing global poverty.</p>

He replied, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, you&#146;ll have plenty of time. One of their Lordships took 35 years before troubling the House with a few words and, even then, the general view was that it wasn&#146;t worth the wait&#148;. I went to the Whips and told them the news. I said, &#147;I&#146;m afraid that I won&#146;t be able to speak&#148;. &#147;That&#146;s the best bit of news we&#146;ve had for some time&#151;it&#146;s a pity there aren&#146;t more of you.

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0711069000072"></a>As a Minister, the noble Baroness the Leader of the House was, as I know from personal experience, quite outstanding at taking Bills through this House, and she always sought sensible compromise in doing so. With her in her new role, we have someone who genuinely wishes to be a Leader of the whole House, and in my view she has made an excellent start. I am also a great admirer of the noble Lord the Chief Whip, who carries out his difficult tasks with good humour. When confronted with trouble, as he often is, he asks himself always what the good people of Telford would do&#151;and they rarely let him down.</p>

<a name="71106-0001.htm_para59"></a><!--meta name="Speaker" CONTENT="Lord Hart of Chilton"-->
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0711069000073"></a>As I am paying tributes, perhaps I may pay two more&#151;to the noble and learned Lords the former Lord Chancellors for whom I worked for nearly 10 years. As your Lordships may imagine, they were not always easy men to advise, but they were a delight to work with, kind and generous. They both had huge energy and ability and were, in quite different ways, formidable advocates. They were prodigiously hard-working and&#151;quite surprisingly for me at least&#151;in going for a train, both of them had an astonishing turn of speed along platforms and going up stairs, leaving me hopelessly trailing behind carrying the bags. They were much loved by their private offices. I should add that the officials working in those offices were also outstanding. They worked long hours, always in good humour, with great loyalty. We are lucky to have such civil servants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0711069000074"></a>Although I received abusive telephone calls for not preventing the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, from abandoning his knee breeches, tights and buckled shoes, in fact, surprisingly, neither Lord Chancellor ever sought my advice on their personal appearance, make-up or clothing. Of course, one might say that their impeccable sense of style was the only guide they needed; indeed, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, has become an icon for the shirt industry. Very sensibly, they rejected my suggestion that they might appear on &#147;The Simpsons&#148;.</p>
